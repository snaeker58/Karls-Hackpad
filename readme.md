## Description
This board was designed to deliver maximum keyboard input with no gimmicks or other inputs.
The addressable RGB allows for software based versatility. Any custom keycaps (or regular keycaps with some tape) and custom set lighting for each key make sure I can use this for anything that needs its own key!
This was made for the Hackclub Hackpad Event, more infos here: [The Hackpad Offical Website](https://hackpad.hackclub.com/).
